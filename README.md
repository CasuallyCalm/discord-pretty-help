# discord-pretty-help

An embed version of the built-in help command for discord.py



Inspired by the DefaultHelpCommand that discord.py uses, but revised for embeds and additional sorting on individual pages that can be "scrolled" through. 

## Installation

`pip install discord-pretty-help`

## Usage

Example of how to use it:

```python
from discord.ext import commands
from pretty_help import PrettyHelp

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!", help_command=PrettyHelp())
```



### Added Optional Args

- `color` - Set the default embed color
- `delete_invoke` - Delete the message that invoked the help command. Requires message delete permission. Defaults is `False`
- `ending_note` - Set the footer of the embed. Ending notes are fed a `commands.Context` (`ctx`) and a `PrettyHelp` (`help`) instance for more advanced customization.
- `image_url` - The url of the image to be used on the embed
- `index_title` - Set the index page name default is *"Categories"*
- `menu` - The menu to use for navigating pages. Uses a `pretty_help.PrettyMenu()` instance. Default is `pretty_help.AppMenu()`
- `no_category` - Set the name of the page with commands not part of a category. Default is "*No Category*"
- `sort_commands` - Sort commands and categories alphabetically
- `show_index` - Show the index page or not
- `thumbnail_url` - The url of the thumbnail to be used on the embed

## Menus

### pretty_help.EmojiMenu 
- Uses Emojis to navigate
- `active_time` - Set the time (in seconds) that the message will be active. Default is 30s
- `delete_after_timeout` - Delete the message after `active_time` instead of removing reactions. Default `False`
- `page_left` - The emoji to use to page left
- `page_right` - The emoji to use to page right
- `remove` - The emoji to use to remove the help message

### pretty_help.AppMenu
- Uses Application Interactions (buttons) for navigating
- `timeout` - The duration the interaction will be active for. Defaults to `None`.
- `ephemeral` - Send as an ephemeral message. Defaults to `False`.

By default, the help will just pick a random color on every invoke. You can change this using the `color` argument:

### Example of using a different menu and customization:

```python

from discord.ext import commands
from pretty_help import EmojiMenu, PrettyHelp

# ":discord:743511195197374563" is a custom discord emoji format. Adjust to match your own custom emoji.
menu = EmojiMenu(page_left="\U0001F44D", page_right="ðŸ‘Ž", remove=":discord:743511195197374563", active_time=5)

# Custom ending note
ending_note = "The ending note from {ctx.bot.user.name}\nFor command {help.clean_prefix}{help.invoked_with}"

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!")

bot.help_command = PrettyHelp(menu=menu, ending_note=ending_note)
```

The basic `help` command will break commands up by cogs. Each cog will be a different page. Those pages can be navigated.

# Changelog

## [2.0.0]
 - Subcommands in pages are indicated with a ðŸ”—, previously it was unclear they were sub commands of the page title

# Notes:
- discord.py must already be installed to use this
