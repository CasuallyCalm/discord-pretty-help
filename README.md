# discord-pretty-help

An embed version of the built in help command for discord.py

Inspired by the DefaultHelpCommand that discord.py uses, but revised for embeds and additional sorting on individual pages that can be "scrolled" through with reactions.

## Installation

`pip install discord-pretty-help`

## Usage

Example of how to use it:

```python
from discord.ext import commands
from pretty_help import PrettyHelp

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!", help_command=PrettyHelp())
```

### Added Optional Args

- `active_time` - Set the time (in seconds) that the message will be active default is 30s
- `color` - Set the default embed color
- `ending_note` - Set the footer of the embed. Ending notes are fed a `commands.Context` (`ctx`) and a `PrettyHelp` (`help`) instance for more advanced customization.
- `index_title` - Set the index page name default is *"Categories"*
- `navigation` - Set the emojis that will control the help menu. Uses a `pretty_help.Navigation()` instance.
- `no_category` - Set the name of the page with commands not part of a category. Default is "*No Category*"
- `sort_commands` - Sort commands and categories alphabetically
- `show_index` - Show the index page or not


By default, the help will just pick a random color on every invoke. You can change this using the `color` argument:

```python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands
from pretty_help import PrettyHelp, Navigation



bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!")

# custom ending note using the command context and help command formatters
ending_note = "The ending not from {ctx.bot.user.name}\nFor command {help.clean_prefix}{help.invoked_with}"

# ":discord:743511195197374563" is a custom discord emoji format. Adjust to match your own custom emoji.
nav = Navigation(":discord:743511195197374563", "ðŸ‘Ž", "\U0001F44D")
color = discord.Color.dark_gold()

bot.help_command = PrettyHelp(navigation=nav, color=color, active_time=5, ending_note=ending_note)

```

The basic `help` command will break commands up by cogs. Each cog will be a different page. Those pages can be navigated with
the arrow embeds. The message is unresponsive after 30s of no activity, it'll remove the reactions to let you know.
